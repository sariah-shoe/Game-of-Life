# Game-of-Life
A project for COMP 2381 where I created an object-oriented version of the Game of Life.

I was given the original code and then refactored it so it made use of objects, a state pattern, singleton pattern, command pattern, observer pattern, and visitor pattern.

This code requires the DUdraw library to be run.
